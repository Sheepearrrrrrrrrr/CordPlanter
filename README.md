## ðŸ”Œ CordPlanter
CordPlanter makes it easier to add custom functionality like commands or enchantments with a Minecraft plugin. With just a `.json` file, you can add anything like commands with requirements and execution.
## Notice
This is really early stage and it only has stuff for me to debug code and the rough outlines for me to eventually add more methods and expressions that can be used. I also plan on adding variables, but that's far away.
## Java application
I also plan on (when I'm done with the initial version of the Minecraft plugin) to make a java application to streamline the making of these `.json` files (I call them workspaces) that are used define functionality. This is still super far away, but I plan to make it eventually.
## Usage
There is a papermc 1.21.6 version which you can compile from source. On first run it will create a workspaces directory in it's config directory, in which you can put your workspaces. If you want an example workspace to look at, take a look at `command_test.json` for command definitions and `enchantment_test.json` for enchantment definitions in this repository.
